# Hidden-Markov-Mode

### Requirements 

  Please specify Number of hidden states (Default is 5 in code)
  
  Please Specify Number of visible states (Default is 5 in code)
  
  Also each element in output sequence must be greater than 0 and less than visible states
  Also Specify intial probabiliy (Pie)
  
  As mentioned above, default number of hidden states is 5 Default number is also 5, all the elements in visible sequence is between [0,4]
  If you have raw sequence on which HMM has to be applied first get number number of unique hidden states and unique visible states and    map states and visible states as follows
  
  
  Given code is implmentation of document https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf
